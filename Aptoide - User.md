# Terms of Service

## 1. Your relationship with Aptoide

### 1.1 

Your use of Aptoide's products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Aptoide under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Aptoide. Aptoide's principal place of business is at R. Frei Jose Maria Evora, 5 Vila Lusitano, Horta das Figueiras, Evora, PT 7005-495. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

### 1.2 

Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Aptoide, your agreement with Aptoide will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.

### 1.3 

Your agreement with Aptoide will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.

### 1.4 

The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Aptoide in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.

### 1.5 

If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.



2. Accepting the Terms

### 2.1 

In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.

### 2.2 

You can accept the Terms by:

- (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Aptoide in the user interface for any Service; or
- (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Aptoide will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

### 2.3 

You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Aptoide, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.

### 2.4 

Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.




## 3. Language of the Terms

### 3.1 

Where Aptoide has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Aptoide.

### 3.2 

If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.




## 4. Provision of the Services by Aptoide

### 4.1 

Aptoide Services enable you to access, browse, purchase and download applications and other digital products for devices running the Android operative system ("Apps"). Apps include any content, ads, services, technology, data, in-app products and other digital materials included in or made available through an App (including after you download it). Apps also include any updates, upgrades and other changes and versions that you later use or download from us. The party that provides an App to us for distribution is the “Publisher” of the App. Most of the Apps we make available on the Aptoide Services are provided and licensed to you by third-party Publishers. 

We may make some Apps available via the Aptoide Services at no charge and others for a price, as further described on our App detail pages.

### 4.2 

Apps may include offers for digital products that are intended to be accessed or used within an App, such as additional or enhanced functionality, media content, or subscription access to content or services (“In-App Products”). None of the products and services available for purchase within an App are Aptoide Services. Aptoide is not a party to, and has no responsibility for, any payment or purchase transactions you make through an App.

### 4.3 

All purchases of Apps are final. We do not accept returns of Apps. Once you have purchased an App, we encourage you to download (if applicable) and access it promptly to be sure you have received it. If you are unable to complete a download or access an App, please contact Aptoide customer service for assistance. Once you purchase an App and we make it available to you, you bear responsibility for completing the download (if applicable) and for all risk of loss after downloading or accessing the App, including any loss due to a mobile device malfunction. We will only accept refund requests made within 24 hours after the purchase.

### 4.4 

Aptoide may have subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Aptoide itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.

### 4.5 

The Publisher of an App may provide a End-User License Agreement (“Publisher’s EULA”) with any App. If there are any conflicts between the Publisher’s EULA and the terms of the End-User License Agremeent provided herein (the “Standard EULA”), then to the extent of such conflict the Standard EULA will control. Aptoide does not have any responsibility or liability related to compliance or non-compliance by you or the Publisher under a Publisher’s EULA. The Standard EULA includes the following end user license terms, and if the App does not include a Publisher’s EULA, these terms will constitute the entire EULA between the Publisher and you:

- (i) The Publisher is the licensor of the App.
- (ii) If the App does not include a Publisher’s EULA that specifies license rights, Publisher grants the end user a limited, nontransferable license to download and use the App only for personal and noncommercial purposes.
- (iii) You may not modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in the App, unless otherwise expressly authorized in writing by Publisher.
- (iv) The App is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Unless otherwise expressly stated in the Publisher’s EULA, Publisher or its licensors own all title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the App, and the App is licensed, not sold.
- (v) The end user acknowledges and agrees that Aptoide has no responsibility or liability with respect to your use of the App or any content or functionality in the App.

### 4.6 

Aptoide is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Aptoide provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.

### 4.7 

As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Aptoide may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Aptoide’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Aptoide when you stop using the Services.

### 4.8 

You acknowledge and agree that if Aptoide disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.

### 4.9 

You acknowledge and agree that while Aptoide may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Aptoide at any time, at Aptoide’s discretion.




## 5. Use of the Services by you

### 5.1 

In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree that any registration information you give to Aptoide will always be accurate, correct and up to date. This information about yourself will be used by Aptoide only for the purpose of providing you the Services, for business performance analysis, consumer profile analysis or for marketing and survey purposes; Aptoide may share this information with third parties, namely partners with whom Aptoide has a business relationship, but only for the mentioned purposes. Information collected about you can also be used to provide you with personalized recommendations.

### 5.2 

You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions. This is applicable to any information that you may upload through the use of the Services, including, but not limited to reviews or ratings.

### 5.3 

You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Aptoide, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Aptoide. You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services through any automated means (including use of scripts or web crawlers) and shall ensure that you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt file present on the Services.

### 5.4 

You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).

### 5.5 

Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Aptoide, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.

### 5.6 

You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Aptoide has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Aptoide may suffer) of any such breach.


## 6. Your passwords and account security

### 6.1 

You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords associated with any account you use to access the Services.

Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely responsible to Aptoide for all activities that occur under your account.

### 6.3 

If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Aptoide immediately at support@aptoide.com.




## 7. Content in the Services

### 7.1 

You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the “Content”.

### 7.2 

You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services, including but not limited to software applications, advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the publishers, sponsors or advertisers who provide that Content to Aptoide (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Aptoide or by the owners of that Content, in a separate agreement.

### 7.3 

Aptoide reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service. The software applications made available through the Services originate from publishers that use Aptoide services, and not by Aptoide, and Aptoide does not necessarily review such applications before being made available. For some of the Services, Aptoide may provide tools to filter out explicit sexual content. These tools include the option to turn Adult Content off. In addition, there are commercially available services and software to limit access to material that you may find objectionable.

### 7.4 

You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk.

### 7.5 

You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Aptoide has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Aptoide may suffer) by doing so.

### 7.6 

You may inform Aptoide of any infringements of yours or any third party’s intellectual property rights or any other rights by reason of the storage by Aptoide, at the direction of any user, of infringing Content. Aptoide will take down any infringing Content, under the terms of the Copyright Notice available at www.aptoide.com.

### 7.7 

The Trusted App sign you may encounter on the Aptoide Services is only a reference to the use by Aptoide, in some selected Content, of automatic tools that intend to prevent the spread of virus or malware; it does not mean any review by Aptoide of the Content for any other purposes, namely copyright infringement.




## 8. Proprietary rights

### 8.1 

You acknowledge and agree that Aptoide (or Aptoide’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential by Aptoide and that you shall not disclose such information without Aptoide’s prior written consent.

### 8.2 

Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Aptoide, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Aptoide’s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.

### 8.3 

If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with Aptoide, then you agree that your use of such features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Aptoide's brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time.

### 8.4 

Other than the limited license set forth in Section 10, Aptoide acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Aptoide, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Aptoide has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

### 8.5 

You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.

### 8.6 

Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Aptoide, you agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.




## 9. License from Aptoide
